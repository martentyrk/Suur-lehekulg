MY DRUM CAREER: I've played drums for as long as I can remember. Ever since I was 2 years old, I was interested in the world of rhythms and I expressed these rhythms by using forks as drumsticks and plates/pots as drums. When I was 4, my brother(14 at the time) got a drumset and I too started playing on it instantly. A few years later, I started playing Guitar Hero and Rock Band and was always most interested in the drum parts. I owe a lot of my earlier life practice hours to these video games. I played these for hours upon hours, which drastically improved my technique, musicality and opened me up to so much good music. I'm sure the games had a HUGE effect on my current drumming style and abilities. At 12-years-old I quit playing drums in a video game and focused more on acoustic drums. I was always fairly passionate about it, but I never practised for more than 2 hours a day, until after I was about 15. At that point I got a lot more into drumming on a daily basis and it slowly but surely became my main hobby and passion. I made my first acoustic drum cover when I was 9 years old. 9 years later, I decided to pursue my passion further and start releasing new covers of me playing to different songs that I like. Making Youtube videos motivates me to practise longer and harder and will hopefully play a role in developing my career in music.

MY GEAR: I play mainly Paiste cymbals, Evans drumheads, Vic Firth drumsticks, Tama drums. I use SHURE SE315 in-ear monitors, Samson microphones and Roland electronics. I always change my cymbal and drumhead setup according to the song/style I'm playing.

TL;DR - Got my first drumset at 4. Made my first drum video at 9 years old. Guitar Hero was my favourite game growing up. 9 years later, started making videos again, in hopes of improving and making drumming my professional career.
