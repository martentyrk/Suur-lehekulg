                <p class="about">
                        I've played drums for as long as I can remember. 
                        Ever since I was 2 years old, I was interested in the world of rhythms and I expressed these rhythms by using forks as drumsticks and plates/pots as drums.
                         When I was 4, my brother(14 at the time) got a drumset and I too started playing on it instantly.
                        A few years later, I started playing Guitar Hero and Rock Band and was always most interested in the drum parts.
                        I owe a lot of my earlier life practice hours to these video games. I played these for hours upon hours, which drastically improved my technique, musicality and opened me up to so much good music.
                        I'm sure the games had a HUGE effect on my current drumming style and abilities. At 12-years-old 
                        I quit playing drums in a video game and focused more on acoustic drums. I was always fairly passionate about it, but I never practised for more than 2 hours a day, until after I was about 15.
                        At that point I got a lot more into drumming on a daily basis and it slowly but surely became my main hobby and passion. 
                        I made my first acoustic drum cover when I was 9 years old. 9 years later, I decided to pursue my passion further and start releasing new covers of me playing to different songs that I like. 
                        Making Youtube videos motivates me to practise longer and harder and will hopefully play a role in developing my career in music.

                        On the tech side use SHURE SE315 in-ear monitors, Samson microphones and Roland electronics.
                        I always change my cymbal and drumhead setup according to the song/style I'm playing so the outcome would be as good
                        as possible.
